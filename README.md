# Data-Analysis-Dashboard

This project is a Coffee Shop Sales Analysis using Excel. I built a dashboard to showcase key insights into sales and customer trends. It includes quantity ordered by hour, day-wise orders, sales of top 5 products, location-wise footfall, size-wise orders placed, and category-wise product sales.Interactive filters for month and day allow users to focus on specific time periods easily.

I have used Orders, Sales, and Product Categories tables, combining them with functions like XLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, and IF statements. The data was cleaned, organized, and visualized with pivot tables and charts. These visualizations make it easy to see peak hours, popular products, and customer distribution across locations.

I have also performed data gathering, data cleaning, data formatting and built pivot tables and pivot charts to show the analysis and visualizations.
